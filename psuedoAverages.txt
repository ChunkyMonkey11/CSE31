TPS 4
------
Intialize variables. (int count, float avg_even, float avg_odd, int sum)
count should start at 1
sum_even = 0 
sum_odd = 0
count_even = 0
count_odd = 0   

start with our exit case so:
if input number = 0:
exit loop 
END if

set temp = to the input number
set digit_sum = 0

while temp > than 0
digit = temp modulo 10
digit_sum = digit_sum
temp = temp divided by 10(integer division)
endwhile

if digit_sum is even
    sum_even = sum_even + input number
    count_even = count_even + 1 
else
    sum_odd = sum_odd + input number
    count_odd = count_odd + 1
endif
until input number = 0

if count_even is greater than 0 
    avg_even = sum_even divided by count_even
else 
    avg_even = 0
end if

if count_odd is greater than 0
   avg_odd = sum_odd divided by count_odd
else 
    avg_odd = 0

end if and display the values
