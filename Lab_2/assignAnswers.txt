Assignment 2:
1. When running the program with "HELLO!" (str1) and "hello!" (str2), the output is NOT expected. The program likely prints garbage characters after "HELLO!hello!" or crashes with a segmentation fault. This happens for two reasons:
   - The `str1` array is only size 10, but "HELLO!" + "hello!" is 12 characters, causing a buffer overflow.
   - The `append` function does not add a null terminator (`\0`) to the end of the new string, so `printf` continues reading memory until it hits a random zero or crashes.

2. When running with "HI!" and "hi!", the output is also NOT expected (it likely prints "HI!hi!" followed by garbage characters). The bug here is that the `append` function does not add a null terminator to the resulting string.
   To fix this, add the line `s1[s1len + s2len] = '\0';` inside the `append` function (after the loop).
   (Note: The buffer overflow issue from Q1 is separate; "HI!" + "hi!" fits within the 10-char limit, so this case isolates the missing null terminator bug).

3. When running with "Hello! How are you?" and "I am fine, thank you!", the output is NOT expected (likely a crash or garbage). This happens because of a massive buffer overflow. The input strings are much larger than the 10-character arrays `str1` and `str2`. Since `scanf("%[^\n]...", ...)` does not limit the number of characters read, it writes past the end of the arrays, overwriting other variables on the stack (like `str2`, return addresses, etc.), causing undefined behavior and crashes.
