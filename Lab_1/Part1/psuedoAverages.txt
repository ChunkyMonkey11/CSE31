TPS 4
------
intialize variables:
- even_count
- even_sum
- odd_count
- odd_sum
- count : starts at 1

run a while loop that until broken will run:
run some if statements that print what number will be entred based on count value(goes up till 7)

create a variable number which will be used to store the input number from the user.(Can assume only integers)
create a temp variable which is copy of number and will be used to calculate the digit sum

if number == 0: break the while loop.(exit condition)
if number is negative (<0): we will make temp the positive of that number

then run a while temp > 0 loop:
    create a var called digit which is equal to temp%10: this operation gives us the last digit of temp:
        - If the last digit is 0 then 0 will be returned if it is not we will get that digit.
    add that digit to digit_sum. 
    then divide temp by 10 which will handle rounding.

after that loop exits:
    - Check if the sum of the digits is even:
        -if even : even_count + 1, and even_sum + the original number being checked.
        -if odd : same process as above for odd. 


now the original loop is over. 
if the even count is not 0 we print the average of input values which sum to an even : even average

if the odd count is not 0 we print the average of input values which sum to an odd number: odd-average
